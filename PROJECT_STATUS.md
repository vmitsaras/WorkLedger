# WorkLedger Project Status

**Current phase:** Phase 1 — Repository foundation
**Current milestone:** Test projects, accessibility harnesses, and baseline CI
**Active task:** `WL-103`
**Status:** Ready
**Last verified:** 2026-08-05

## Current objective

Configure Vitest projects, React Testing Library, API/database integration harnesses, Playwright, axe/accessibility helpers, and baseline CI for the existing workspace. Add only credible smoke evidence and test infrastructure; do not begin product features, database schema work, design-system implementation, or `apps/site` in `WL-103`.

## Verified decisions

- Product name: WorkLedger.
- One organization per self-hosted installation for the initial release.
- React web application with a separate Fastify API.
- PostgreSQL source of truth.
- React Aria plus shadcn React Aria source components and Tailwind.
- TanStack Query for server state.
- Framework-independent domain engine before UI feature development.
- WCAG 2.2 AA baseline.
- Immutable punch events, ledger-based balances, effective-dated policies, and monthly locking.
- Teams are the only MVP organization grouping; departments are deferred.
- Approval delegation is excluded from the MVP.
- English is the only shipped MVP locale; formatting remains locale-aware.
- Employee self-service profile data is read-only; HR-owned employment facts are not self-editable.
- In-app notification records are core; external email delivery is optional and non-transactional.
- Manager scope is current direct reports only and is evaluated when each request is handled.
- Explicit unauthorized targets return `403`; scoped collections apply authorization before counts and pagination.
- Self-approval and privileged self-adjustment are prohibited even for combined roles.
- System-administrator capability grants technical access only, not HR/domain data.
- A work session runs from clock-in to clock-out and contains break-free work intervals; breaks are excluded exactly once.
- Effective-date ranges are half-open, and stable employee identity survives non-overlapping employment periods.
- Account/employee links are one-to-one while active; team and manager assignments have one current value per employee.
- Derived intervals split at organization-local midnight while source sessions/events remain intact.
- Ordinary clock actions use one trusted server occurrence instant and strictly increasing per-employee event sequence numbers.
- Every attendance command carries the latest `attendanceRevision`; one successful command increments it once, while rejection and replay do not.
- Every attendance mutation requires a scoped, fingerprinted `Idempotency-Key`; matching retries replay the terminal outcome and attendance keys do not expire in the MVP.
- Confirmed on-break clock-out atomically appends `BREAK_END` then `CLOCK_OUT` at one instant and increments the attendance revision once.
- Punch occurrence/manual attendance inputs use minute precision; interval, daily, policy, and display calculations apply no later rounding.
- Daily calculations have identified inputs and `PROVISIONAL`, `INCOMPLETE`, or `COMPLETE` status; only complete past dates may post.
- Holiday dates reduce expected and default absence consumption/credit to zero while preserving actual worked credit.
- Nonexistent manual local times are rejected; ambiguous times require one valid explicit UTC offset.
- Ordinary organization-timezone changes are blocked after time-dependent employee facts exist.
- Complete past dates post one base daily delta; later unlocked recalculations append only the difference, and locked changes use post-lock adjustment.
- Leave entitlement, reservation, deduction, restoration, coverage, credit, and expected-reduction amounts use integer minutes; day equivalents are presentation only.
- Half-day absence is an exact first/second obligation partition; minute coverage cannot mix with full/half coverage on the same local date.
- Approval-required entitlement absence reserves on submission, releases and deducts on approval, and releases without deduction on rejection, changes requested, or withdrawal.
- Negative vacation approval is manager-blocked and requires an eligible non-self HR override with a reason.
- Report-and-acknowledge sickness is effective once on report; acknowledgement adds no second effect, and the default retrospective window is seven configurable calendar days.
- Unpaid leave reduces covered expectation by default and contributes no absence credit.
- Cancellation is a separate versioned workflow that may target exact remaining coverage, restores no more than the linked deduction, and never rewrites the original request/decision.
- Sickness has no diagnosis, note, clinician, or attachment field; type and sensitive context stay out of team DTOs, URLs, browser persistence, generic notifications/exports, technical audit, and operational logs.
- Monthly readiness and adjusted-after-lock are derived; persisted workflow states are open, submitted, changes requested, approved, and locked.
- Approval creates a reconciled immutable snapshot; a separate eligible current non-self manager action locks that exact snapshot, with no MVP unlock.
- Submitted/approved months require an explicit changes-requested transition before ordinary mutation; locked changes append uniquely linked adjustments against the preserved baseline.
- Monthly snapshots include versioned daily calculation/source/ledger evidence but exclude sickness classification, notes, entitlement balances, and other purpose-incompatible HR detail.
- The MVP application has 31 canonical route patterns plus three explicit host-operator workflows, each with stable implementation ownership.
- Request and approval routes are type-neutral; sensitive workflow types, notes, reasons, entitlement values, and person-identifying search text never become URL state.
- Route navigation updates the document title and visible heading with deterministic focus behavior; screen states have persistent, non-duplicative focus and announcement rules.
- Narrow-screen calendars use an equivalent agenda/list when the grid is unsuitable, and responsive transformations preserve reading order, relationships, and actions.
- System-administrator routes expose only technical account/session, safe operations, and technical-audit data; restore, secret rotation, and upgrade remain host-operator workflows.
- WorkLedger treats authentication, employment, attendance, benefits, sickness-related absence, approvals, audit, exports, and backups as high-sensitivity data with purpose-specific access and retention.
- Invite-only credentials use 15–128 character passwords, local common-password rejection, 30-minute single-use reset grants, and 24-hour single-use invitation grants.
- Sessions are PostgreSQL-backed and immediately revocable; stateless/session caches and persistent remember-me are excluded, with 30-minute idle, 12-hour absolute, and 15-minute freshness boundaries.
- Production uses one canonical HTTPS origin, secure host-only cookies, enabled Better Auth checks, WorkLedger session-bound CSRF protection, protected-response no-store caching, and no sensitive browser persistence.
- Caddy is the reference production proxy while the observable TLS, trusted-header, network-isolation, health, and security-header contract remains proxy-agnostic.
- Each deployment must own an explicit retention profile by data class; ordinary deletion never destroys source, ledger, snapshot, or required audit integrity, and restored sessions/grants are invalidated before activation.
- The canonical repository is the existing public `vmitsaras/WorkLedger` GitHub project and WorkLedger-owned source/documentation uses the existing MIT license.
- Root, app, and package manifests remain private/internal for the MVP; internal names use `@workledger/*` and cross-workspace edges use `workspace:*`, with no npm publication workflow.
- The accepted dependency graph keeps domain, contracts, UI, and config independent; database may import domain; web may import UI/contracts; API composes domain/contracts/database; test-utils is test-only.
- Cross-project deep/sibling-source imports, app imports, undeclared path-alias edges, workspace cycles, production test/config imports, and browser imports of authoritative domain/database/server code are prohibited and must fail executable Phase 1 checks.
- pnpm with one root lockfile and no Turborepo is sufficient for the initial workspace; new production projects, dependency edges, orchestration, or package publication require an ADR.
- The root toolchain is pinned to Node `24.18.0` LTS and pnpm `11.20.0` stable; the generated lockfile records the Node runtime integrity variants.
- The exact workspace is two non-importable application shells plus six packages with explicit exports; five expose only their typed root and config also exposes its accepted tooling surfaces. `apps/site` remains deferred to Phase 11.
- The eight accepted internal edges resolve through `@workledger/*` package roots and emit typed ESM entries; no sibling-source or deep import exists in the scaffold.
- TypeScript `7.0.2` is governed by a shared strict composite configuration; the root solution and per-project references must exactly mirror the eight runtime edges and cannot use path aliases.
- Seven explicit development-only `@workledger/config` edges provide shared TypeScript configuration without making config production runtime code.
- ESLint `10.8.0` checks JavaScript/tooling, Prettier `3.9.6` checks code/config formatting, and `es-module-lexer` `2.3.1` powers repository-owned source-boundary checks. Current `typescript-eslint` is not installed because its `<6.1.0` TypeScript peer range excludes TypeScript 7.
- Root commands reject a mismatched active toolchain, missing/unexpected or non-private workspace projects/configuration, alternate/nested lockfiles, wrong/non-`workspace:*` internal edges, TypeScript-reference drift/path aliases, dependency cycles, application exports, package export drift, forbidden/deep/app/test/config/browser-server source imports, and package-publication paths.
- Phase 0 passed with all seven roadmap criteria evidenced; the accepted catalog contains 85 contiguous single-outcome examples, and every remaining open decision has an explicit later owner/deadline.

## Latest completed task

### `WL-102` — Configure strict tooling and executable source boundaries

- Changed: added shared strict TypeScript/ESM, an eight-project solution/reference graph, explicit config-only development edges/exports, ESLint flat config, Prettier/EditorConfig, a repository-owned import scanner, and physical positive/negative boundary fixtures; removed the temporary shell-build runner.
- Verified: formatting, ESLint, strict project-reference typechecking, all 18 native contract/fixture tests, all eight builds/emitted imports, the applicable full root quality gate, frozen/offline installation, and diff hygiene pass under pinned Node `24.18.0`/pnpm `11.20.0`.
- Decisions: ESLint `10.8.0`, `@eslint/js` `10.0.1`, Prettier `3.9.6`, `globals` `17.9.0`, and `es-module-lexer` `2.3.1` are exact stable tooling pins. TypeScript source uses strict compiler diagnostics, formatting, and the repository scanner because current `typescript-eslint` `8.66.0` does not support TypeScript 7.
- Accessibility: no UI behavior was created; DOM libraries are confined to web/UI projects, while domain/contracts keep the ambient-type-free runtime-neutral base. Automated accessibility infrastructure remains `WL-103`.
- Security/data: production config/test imports, browser/server boundary violations, undeclared aliases, deep/sibling/app imports, wrong references, cycles, and publication paths fail. No secret, employee data, persistence, network, authentication, telemetry, or deployment surface was added.
- Remaining risk: test runners, axe/Playwright/browser/API/database harnesses, CI execution, and dependency/license/secret scanning are not yet present; current integration/E2E root commands still have no project-specific runner work.
- Next task: `WL-103`.

## Current blockers

No `WL-103` blocker remains. D-201/D-202, D-200/D-204, and D-502 retain their recorded later owners/deadlines. The strict project/tooling boundary is ready; test libraries, environment-specific harness ownership, CI jobs, and executable accessibility smoke evidence remain to be selected and configured.

## Next task

`WL-103 — Configure test projects, accessibility/browser/API/database harnesses, and baseline CI.`
